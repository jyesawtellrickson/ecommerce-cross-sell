# Cross-Sell Algorithm

Repo containing a proof-of-concept cross-sell algorithm for an ecommerce platform. The basic algorithm uses a cosine similarity to determine the similarity of products.

The more advanced model consists of a neural net built with Keras. The key difference being that it can recommend products that the user has already purchased which consists of a large portion of the dataset.
